# Document Object ðŸ¤œðŸ¤› Window Object

In web development, the terms "document" and "window" refer to two important objects that are part of the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a programming interface for web documents and represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. Both the document and window objects play crucial roles in manipulating and interacting with the content of a web page.

## 1. Document Object
+ The document object represents the entire HTML document.
+ It provides an interface to interact with the content and structure of the document, allowing you to manipulate elements, modify styles, and handle events.
+ Examples of tasks involving the document object include selecting and modifying HTML elements, creating new elements, changing the content of elements, and handling user events.
  ```
  var element = document.getElementById("exampleElement");
  element.textContent = "New content";
  ```

## 2. Window Object
+ The window object represents the browser window or, more specifically, the global context in which the JavaScript code is executed.
+ It serves as the global object for JavaScript in a browser environment and provides methods and properties for managing the browser window, navigating to URLs, setting timeouts, and handling events.
+ Many global functions and properties, such as setTimeout, alert, and console, are part of the window object.
  ```
  // Example: Opening a new browser window
  window.open("https://www.example.com", "_blank");
  ```

## Summary
In summary, the document object deals with the content and structure of the HTML document, allowing you to manipulate and interact with elements, while the window object provides a broader scope, offering methods and properties for managing the overall browser environment. It's worth noting that both objects are part of the larger DOM and work together to enable dynamic and interactive web pages.
